# SvelteKit Base

> A SvelteKit boilerplate tailored to my own preferences. Uses TypeScript, supports SASS and has more than you might need for your application. Might work for you too, who knows.

This boilerplate uses the base SvelteKit project, but tailored to my own preferences, according to some projects I've built in the past. There are some stuff from the documentation too (in hooks), so I don't have to open a browser to look it up.

Some features:
- Basic reference on hooks and writable stores;
- Markdown loader using `vite-plugin-markdown` and `markdown-it`, so you can just import Markdown with frontmatter right into your pages;
- `highlight.js` used on `markdown-it` for code blocks;
- PostCSS and SASS support with auto import of some globals;
